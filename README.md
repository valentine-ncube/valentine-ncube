# 👋 Hi there, I'm Valentine Ncube

I'm a junior web developer with a background in healthcare and an interest in building digital solutions that make life easier. I recently completed the Mission Ready Digital Tech Programme, where I developed real-world full-stack applications using modern web technologies.

I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating in Agile teams, and continuously learning new tools and frameworks to improve my craft.
